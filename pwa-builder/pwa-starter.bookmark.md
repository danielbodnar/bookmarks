## PWA Starter {#pwa-starter dir="auto" tabindex="-1"}

[**Straight to Full Documentation**](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/starter/quick-start){rel="nofollow"}

The PWABuilder pwa-starter is our opinionated, best practices, production tested starter that we use to build all of our PWAs, including [PWABuilder itself](https://blog.pwabuilder.com/posts/introducing-the-brand-new-pwa-builder/){rel="nofollow"}! The pwa-starter is a starter codebase, just like create-react-app or the Angular CLI can generate, that uses the PWABuilder team\'s preferred front-end tech stack. We also have a CLI tool to allow you to create a PWA template from the command line.

## Jump Right In {#jump-right-in dir="auto" tabindex="-1"}

[](#jump-right-in){#user-content-jump-right-in aria-label="Permalink: Jump Right In"}

Install the PWABuilder CLI:

`npm i -g @pwabuilder/cli`

And create a new app with this command:

`pwa create`

And start your app locally with:

`pwa start`

And that\'s it! Good luck on your Progressive Web App adventure!

-   Scores close to 100 on Lighthouse out of the box
-   Has everything needed to be installable in the browser
-   Is ready to be package for the app stores using [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/){rel="nofollow"}
-   Uses the [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://azure.github.io/static-web-apps-cli){rel="nofollow"} which enables emulating your production environment locally, and gets you ready for deploying to Azure Static Web Apps!

and all with just a few button clicks ðŸ˜Š.
